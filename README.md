# mnist-digit-classification-ann
I built an Artificial Neural Network to classify handwritten digits (0–9) using the MNIST dataset.
The goal was to understand how neural networks work in a real example.

---

###What I Did

* Loaded the MNIST dataset
* Normalized the pixel values
* Flattened the 28x28 images
* Built an ANN using TensorFlow/Keras
* Trained the model and tested its accuracy

---

###Model Architecture

* Input layer (784 neurons)
* Hidden layer with ReLU (128 neurons)
* Output layer with Softmax

---

###Result
The model successfully predicts handwritten digits with high accuracy.

---

###Tech Used

* Python
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Scikit-learn
* TensorFlow

Built while learning Deep Learning fundamentals.
